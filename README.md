# SALI
## Simari Auto Log In (Chrome only!)
It is a piece of software that was built using the AutoHotkey script. Designed specifically for ULM student to easily login without opening a browser first!


# NOTE (IMPORTANT)
Your OS will detect the setup (or even the software) as a virus! This is called false positive, the software doesn't contain any malware or virus. Before installing make sure to:
1. Turn off antivirus (windows defender, etc.)
2. Turn off internet

After that, you could turn them back on!
